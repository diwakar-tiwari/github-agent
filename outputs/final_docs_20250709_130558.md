**Gemma2:2b Model Integration with Ollama and Langchain**
===========================================================

**Overview**
------------

This codebase integrates the Gemma2:2b model with Ollama and Langchain, enabling the utilization of the model's capabilities within a conversational AI framework. The integration allows for seamless interaction with the model, facilitating tasks such as text generation, question answering, and more.

**Usage**
---------

To utilize the Gemma2:2b model with Ollama and Langchain, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `cloned_repo` directory.
2. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed, including Ollama and Langchain.
3. Run the `app.py` script to initiate the integration.

**Architecture Summary**
------------------------

The architecture of this codebase consists of the following components:

* **Gemma2:2b Model**: The Gemma2:2b model is a pre-trained language model used for various NLP tasks.
* **Ollama**: Ollama is a conversational AI framework that enables interaction with the Gemma2:2b model.
* **Langchain**: Langchain is a library used for integrating the Gemma2:2b model with Ollama.

**Technical Details**
---------------------

### Dependencies

* Ollama
* Langchain

### Code Structure

The codebase consists of a single Python script, `app.py`, which integrates the Gemma2:2b model with Ollama and Langchain.

### Integration Process
